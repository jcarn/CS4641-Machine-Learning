Not a lot of code for this one. I used WEKA for all analysis and most graphs, and then code from Project 1 for the rest. My datasets (and the code I used) can be found below. Just plug the arff files in Project3/datasets and Project1/data/proj3 into weka and poke around. All parameters used are in the analysis.

Oh, I almost forgot, I used the StudentsFilters package for WEKA to get the ICA filter, so you’ll need to install that.
